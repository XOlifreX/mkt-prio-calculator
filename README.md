This application allows you to view which DKG's you could prioritise to obtain based on a given list of tracks.
The idea is to pass a list of tracks you don't have a Top shelf on yet and based on all the ones you've passed, it will make a list of DKG's you should get to fill all the Top shelf spots for those tracks.

I use this application myself to see which DKG's I should get for the upcoming ranked tracks so I'm covered for those.

The application gets the track and DKG info from Larry98's sheet application. Export the coverage and dkg tables as csv's and place them in the Data folder with the name specified in the code. The csv's in question are not included in the repository.

Might make a nice GUI for this, might not. I will see.
